# Scripts

- `download_SRRs.sh`: script for downloading list of accession SRA files with SRATools. 
- `4_16STaxAss_workflow.sh`: steps for running the TaxASS scripts
- `calc_full_length_pident.R`: TaxASS script to calculate full length PID from BLAST table
- `filter_seqIDs_by_pident.R`: TaxASS script to identify sequences by PID
- `find_seqIDs_blast_removed.py`: TaxASS script to identify sequences that were removed by blast
- `create_fastas_given_seqIDs.py`: TaxASS script to create new fasta files based on seqID
- `plot_blast_hits_stats.R`: TaxASS script for sanity check plots
- `convert_shared_file.R`: Ben Peterson's script for converting the shared file to a relative abundance table
- `get-representative-seqs.R`: Modification of Alex Linz's script for pulling out representative sequences for each OTU and making a representative FASTA file



# Final data input files for Scripts 

- `WinterTags.final.fasta`: Raw FASTA file with gaps for getting representative sequences with the script `get-representative-seqs.R`. Note, this MUST be the raw FASTA and not the reformatted to get rid of gaps, or else the distance matrix cannot be calculated correctly due to unequal lengths of sequences
- `WinterTag-repseqs.fasta`: FASTA file of representative sequences for each OTU, generated by the `get-representative-seqs.R` script
- `WinterTags.OTU.taxonomy`: Final taxonomy file of a combination of GreenGenes and the Freshwater Training set classifications for input into `WinterTagsAn.R` for data exploration
- `WinterTags.final.shared`: Final shared OTU table for input into `WinterTagsAn.R` for data exploration
