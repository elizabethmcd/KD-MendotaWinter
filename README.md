# Microbial Community Profiling of Winter Seasons in Lake Mendota

This repository contains notes, data, and code for a project profiling the microbial community of winter seasons in Lake Mendota from our existing time series and continuing a more in-depth time series sampling scheme. 

Data was downloaded from NCBI SRA with accession number PRJEB14911 for the Mendota Tag Time-Series project and deposited into the McMahon Lab fileshare under the `/home/emcdaniel/Mendota-Tag-TimeSeries` directory. From this we are analyzing the previous winter time series data.
